# sentiment_analysis

Analyze text data to determine whether the sentiment is **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**, using machine learning / NLP techniques.

## üìñ Overview

This project builds a sentiment analysis model that classifies text (e.g., reviews, tweets) into sentiment categories. It includes steps for text cleaning, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and predicting new text sentiments.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Text preprocessing: cleaning (removing noise like punctuation, stop words), lowercasing, tokenization.
- Feature extraction using techniques like Bag of Words, TF-IDF.
- Multiple classification algorithms (could include Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines etc.).
- Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix).
- Predicting sentiment of new/unseen text inputs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Flow (in simple terms)

1. **Data Loading** ‚Äì Load dataset of text and corresponding sentiment labels  
2. **Preprocessing** ‚Äì Clean the text: remove punctuation, stop words, perform tokenization, maybe stemming or lemmatization  
3. **Feature Engineering** ‚Äì Convert text to numerical features: e.g., TF-IDF vectors or count vectors  
4. **Model Training** ‚Äì Train one or more classification models using training data  
5. **Evaluation** ‚Äì Evaluate model performance using validation or test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
6. **Prediction** ‚Äì Use the trained model to classify new text inputs
